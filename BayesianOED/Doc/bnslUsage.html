<h2>Quick start</h2>

This software has no external dependencies. (Under the BNSL/Foreign
directory, you will find code extracted from other Matlab toolboxes,
such as the Bayes Net Toolbox, and the Structure Learning
Toolbox.)
However, the Java code for ADtrees only seems to work for Matlab 2007a
(7.4) or later.

<ul>
<li>Download and unzip <a href="bnsl2.zip">bnsl2.zip</a>.
<li> In Matlab, change the directory to the newly created BNSL folder.
<li> Run the script mkPath, which adds all necessary folders to the
path, and compiles Mex files (if required).  
<li> Run cancerDemo, cancerDemoInter, sachsDemo, dbnDemo.
</ul>


<h2>Major features</h2>

The main features of the package are described below.
See the <a href="#references">references</a> for details.
The user is assumed to be familiar with these papers.

<ul>
<li> Computes G_map = arg max_G p(G|D) exactly using dynamic
programming (DP) using the algorithm of Silander06,
where G is a DAG and D is data.
This takes O(d 2^d) time and space,
so is limited to about 20 variables.

<p>
<li> Computes edge marginals
p(G_{ij}=1|D) = sum_G I(G(i,j)=1) p(G|D)
exactly using DP using the algorithm of Koivisto04/06.
This takes O(d 2^d) time and space,
so is limited to about 20 variables.

<p>
<li> Computes  p(G_{ij}=1|D) approximately
using MCMC with a DP-based proposal; see Eaton07_uai.
This allows one to use an arbitrary prior.
It also supports standard local proposals,
order-space sampling (see Friedman03),
and Gibbs sampling on the adjacency matrix.

<p>
<li> Supports various models of intervention; see Eaton07_aistats for details.

<p>
<li> Supports BDe score for Multinomial models with Dirichlet priors,
and BGe score for Gaussian models with Gaussian-Gamma priors.
</ul>


<h2>Basic DP</h2>

We illustrate the core DP algorithms using the 5 node cancer network
below; see <tt>cancerDemo</tt> for the details.
<p>
<center>

</center>
<p>
Suppose the graph prior is uniform over all parents sets
of size <= maxFanIn.
We first construct the all families log prior matrix
<pre>
aflp(i,gi) =  log p(parents of i = gi)
</pre>
which is a 5x32 matrix, since there are 2^5=32 possible parent sets.
(Actually, there are only 2^4, since Xi cannot include itself; the
corresponding illegal entries are set to -Inf.)
<pre>
nNodes = 5;
maxFanIn = nNodes - 1; 
aflp = mkAllFamilyLogPrior( nNodes, 'maxFanIn', maxFanIn ); 
</pre>
Now let us create some data.
We can sample  data from the cancer network, using random CPTs,
using <tt>cancerMakeData</tt>.
The resulting data is stored in
<tt>cancerDataObs.mat</tt>.
Let us load this and compute the
5x32 all families log marginal likelihood matrix
<pre>
aflml(i,gi) = sum_n log p(X(i,n) | X(gi,n))
</pre>
We can do this as follows:
<pre>
load 'cancerDataObs.mat' % from cancerMakeData 
% data is size d*N (nodes * cases), values are {1,2}
aflml = mkAllFamilyLogMargLik( data, 'nodeArity', repmat(2,1,nNodes), ...
			       'impossibleFamilyMask', aflp~=-Inf, ...
			       'priorESS', 1);
</pre>
This uses ADtrees to cache the sufficient statistics (see Moore98 for
details). This is implemented in Java.

<p>

Finally we are ready to compute the optimal DAG
<pre>
optimalDAG = computeOptimalDag(aflml); % max p(D|G)
%optimalDAG = computeOptimalDag(aflml+aflp); % max p(D,G)
</pre>
We can also compute exact edge marginals using DP:
<pre>
epDP = computeAllEdgeProb( aflp, aflml ); 
</pre>
In this simple setting, we can compute exact edge marginals by brute
force enumeration over all 29,281 DAGs of 5 nodes:
<pre>
epEnumer = computeAllEdgeProb_Exact(0, aflml); % 0 denotes uniform prior
</pre>
If we visualize these heat maps, we see that they are different.
<p>
<center>
<IMG SRC="Figures/cancerDemoHeatMaps.png">
</center>
<p>
This is because the DP algorithm implicitly assumes
a special "modular" prior; see Friedman03 and Koivisto04.
We will fix this below using MCMC sampling.


<h2>Basic MCMC</h2>

Let us now fix the biased p(G) problem by  using Metropolis Hastings,
as described in Eaton07.
We use a proposal that 10% of the time samples DAGs based
on the DP edge marginals,
and 90% of the time does standard local moves.
<pre>
[samples, diagnostics, runningSum] = sampleDags(@uniformGraphLogPrior, aflml, ...
				    'burnin', 100, 'verbose', true, ...
				    'edgeMarginals', epDP, 'globalFrac', 0.1, ...
				    'thinning', 2, 'nSamples', 5000);
epMCMC = samplesToEdgeMarginals(samples);
</pre>
The heat map above shows that  this gives the same results as
exhaustive enumeration with a uniform prior.
The MCMC routine uses Java hash tables to represent samples of
graphs compactly.
<p>
Order sampling is in the OrderMcmc directory.


<h2>Interventional data</h2>

To learn the orientation of all the edges in a DAG,
we need interventional data.
We will illustrate this using the cancer network;
see <tt>cancerDemoInter</tt> for details.
<p>
Let us load some data where we have performed a perfect intervention
on node A.
The 5x700 matrix <tt>clamped</tt> is defined
so clamped(i,n)=1 iff node i is set by intervention in case n.
We modify the computation of the marginal likelihoods to remove cases
that were set by intervention.
<pre>
load 'cancerDataInterA.mat' % from cancerMakeData 
nNodes = 5;
maxFanIn = nNodes - 1; 
aflp = mkAllFamilyLogPrior( nNodes, 'maxFanIn', maxFanIn ); 
aflml_perfect = mkAllFamilyLogMargLik( data, 'nodeArity', repmat(2,1,nNodes), ...
			       'impossibleFamilyMask', aflp~=-Inf, ...
			       'priorESS', 1, ...
			       'clampedMask', clamped);
epDP_perfect = computeAllEdgeProb( aflp, aflml_perfect ); 
</pre>
This lets  us recover the true structure uniquely.
If we ignore the fact that this is interventional data (by omitting
the clamped parameter), we get the wrong answer, as shown below.

<h2>Uncertain interventions</h2>

If we do not know which nodes are affected by the intervention,
we can add the intervention node to the graph and learn its children
(targets), as described in Eaton07_aistats.
Let us call the intervention node number 6.
This node is always clamped; let us put it in state 1 half the time,
and state 2 for the rest, and append this to the normal data.
<pre>
N = size(data,2);
nObservationCases = N/2; % # observational data cases
nInterventionCases = N/2; % no interventions
assert(N==nObservationCases+nInterventionCases);
data_uncertain = [data; [ones(1,nObservationCases) 2*ones(1,nInterventionCases)]];
clamped_uncertain = [zeros(size(clamped)); ones(1,N)];
</pre>
When learning the topology, we do not want to allow connections
between the intervention nodes, or back from the backbone nodes to the
intervention nodes.
We can enforce this by putting the intevention node in layer 1,
and the other nodes in layer 2,
and restricting the fan-in between and withing layers as follows
<pre>
% fan-in
%     L1  L2
% L1   0   1    % only 1 intervention parent allowed for L2 nodes
% L2   0   max  % only max # paretns allowed in total for L2 nodes

maxFanIn_uncertain = [ 0 1 ; 0 maxFanIn ]; 
layering = [2*ones(1,nNodes) 1];
nodeArity = 2*ones(1,nNodes);
nodeArity_uncertain = [nodeArity 2];

aflp_uncertain = mkAllFamilyLogPrior( nNodes+1, 'maxFanIn', maxFanIn_uncertain, ...
				      'nodeLayering', layering );

aflml_uncertain = mkAllFamilyLogMargLik(data_uncertain, ...
		'nodeArity', nodeArity_uncertain, 'clampedMask', clamped_uncertain, ...
		'impossibleFamilyMask', aflp_uncertain~=-Inf, 'verbose', 0 );

epDP_uncertain = computeAllEdgeProb( aflp_uncertain, aflml_uncertain ); 
</pre>
We see from the picture above that we learn that node 6 targets node 1
(A), and we also correctly recover the backbone.

<h2>Layering</h2>

In general, layering is defined as follows.
The maxFanIn matrix is upper triangular.
M(i,j) is the maximum fan-in allowed from j into i;
M(i,i) is the maximum fan-in from any preceeding layer;
use -1 to mean "don't care".
<p>
For example, suppose nodes (1,3) are in layer 1
and nodes (2,4,5) are in layer 2.
We can allow connections from L1 to L2, and within L2, as follows:
<pre>
layering = [1 2 1 2 2 ]; 
maxFanIn = [0 -1 ; 0 3 ];
</pre>
M(1,1)=0 means no connections into L1.
M(1,2)=-1 means no constraints on the number of L1->L2 connections
(modulo constraints imposed by M(2,2));
M(2,2)=3 means at most 3 parents for any node in L2.


<h2>DBNs</h2>

We can use the DP algorithm to learn edge marginals for fully observed
DBNs.
If we have d nodes per time slice,
we just learn a 2d x 2d DAG,
with a layering constraint that there can be no connections backwards
in time.
The key function is <tt>transformDbnData</tt> which takes a dxT time
series and computes a (2d)x(T-1) matrix of two-slice samples.
Then we use the standard DP code above.
See <tt>dbnDemo</tt> for a simple example.



<h2>Graph layout</h2>

A very simple graph drawing function (based on code by Ali Cemgil) is
illustrated in <tt>cancerDemo</tt> and can be called as shown below:
<pre>
myDrawGraph(dag, 'labels', labels, 'layout', graphicalLayout)
</pre>
If the layout coordinates are omitted, the function lays the nodes out
in a circle.
<p>
To achieve higher quality results,
I recommed the free windows program
called
<a href="http://vlado.fmf.uni-lj.si/pub/networks/pajek/">pajek</a>.
A function <tt>adj2pajek2</tt> will convert a dag to the pajek format;
this file can then be read in and automatically layed out in a pretty
way.

<h2>Analysing biological data</h2>

A more interesting example can be found in <tt>sachsDemo</tt>, where
we learn the MAP optimal DAG and edge marginals using DP
from 5400 interventional samples of 11 variables from the Sachs05 paper.
The effects of various graph priors (using MCMC) is
studied in <tt>sachsDemoPriors</tt>.
