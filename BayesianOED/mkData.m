% interventions: a cell array of interventions to be performed. each entry
%           of the array is itself a cell array denoting the interventions (assignments) for that case.
%           [] denotes an observed node (ie. non-interventional).
%           ie. for a 3 node network, { {2, [], []}, {[], 1, -1} } means there are two types of
%           intervention. in the first case, node 1 is set to the value 2 and the other nodes are just
%           observed. in the second case, node 1 is just observed, node 2 is set to the value 1, and node
%           3 has a a value chosen for it uniformly at random (from 1..M where M is the node arity)
% nInterventionCases: number of interventional cases to sample -- if there
%           is more than one type of intervention, an equal number of each type is
%           sampled such that the total number of intervnetional cases is nInterventionCases
